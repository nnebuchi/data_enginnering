1. docker build --help

2. pip list

3. select count(1) from ny_taxi where lpep_pickup_datetime::date = date '2019-01-15' and lpep_dropoff_datetime::date = date '2019-01-15';

4. There are two possible ways .
The simlest is SELECT * FROM ny_taxi
WHERE trip_distance = (select max(trip_distance)from ny_taxi)

that gave the right answer

but if there was no column for trip distance, another option could be:

SELECT * FROM ny_taxi
WHERE (lpep_dropoff_datetime - lpep_pickup_datetime) = (select max(lpep_dropoff_datetime - lpep_pickup_datetime)from ny_taxi)

however, this gave the wrong answer

5. select count(1) from ny_taxi where lpep_pickup_datetime::date = date '2019-01-01' and passenger_count = 2;
select count(1) from ny_taxi where lpep_pickup_datetime::date = date '2019-01-01' and passenger_count = 3;
